#summary Getting started with the ardupilotmegacomm library.

= Compiling the library =
  * Dependencies
    * Boot > 1.40 (for asio serial), headers, boost-thread-mt, boost-system-mt 
  * Build System
    * CMake > 2.60 
  * Build Steps
    * svn checkout http://ardupilotmegacomm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ardupilotmegacomm-read-only
    * go to the ardupilotmegacomm-read-only directory
    * create a build directory and launch cmake from it, then make: 
    * mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..;make
    * try out the test program

= Hardware in the Loop Walkthrough =

Install latest ardupilot-mega release from svn onto ardupilotmega board:
  * svn checkout http://ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/svn/Sketchbook/trunk/ ardupilot-mega-read-only
  * Copy APM_Config_xplane.h to APM_Config.h
  * Use arduino ide to compile and upload to the board

Execute the test program:
  
    * ./test/hilcomm /dev/ttyUSB0 38400

= ArduPilotMega Binary Protocol Walkthrough =

Install latest ardupilot-mega release from svn onto ardupilotmega board:
  * svn checkout http://ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/svn/Sketchbook/trunk/ ardupilot-mega-read-only
  * Copy APM_Config_xplane.h to APM_Config.h
  * Change GCS_PROTOCOL to GCS_PROTOCOL_STANDARD
  * Change ENABLE_HIL ENABLED to ENABLED_HIL DISABLED
  * Optionally change other settings based on your setup
  * Use arduino ide to compile and upload to the board

Execute the test program:
  
    * ./test/bincomm /dev/ttyUSB0 38400

= Using the library for your project = 
  * Install Option 1: Build from source
    * In the build directory build the code and then sudo make install.
  * Install Option 2: Use a package
    * Linux: download .deb file, dpkg -i ardupilotmegacomm-0.0.1.deb
    * Windows: don't have a packaged yet
  * How to build against it
    * Manual
      * LDFLAGS : -lardupilotmegacomm
      * CPPFLAGS : -I/usr/include/ardupilotmegacomm
    * pkg-config
     * ardupilotmegacomm.pc included in install

= Packaging =
  * Linux: cpack -G DEB
  * Windows: cpack -G NSIS (If someone on windows can make a package for 0.0.1 it would be much appreciated.)
